# Predict-Blood-Donations

## Introduction 
While working for Rotaract Club of MSIT from last 3 years one of my main responsibility was to organise Blood Donation Camps, and it is an amazing event to organise because it gives you a feeling that you are helping for a right cause which saves life.

### Problem
One of the major problem while organising the Blood Donation Camp was that to convince the people who were walking near the camp to be a donor which results in 70% of the people were not interesting in donating due to reasons like they have work to do, they need to go somewhere etc.
There's this one time in every year when we organise a blood donation camp in Adarsh Public School, New Delhi on the day of parent teacher meeting, so parents were already told about the donation camp and almost 80-90% of the parents become donors. 

## Description

Use Python to explore data related to blood donors and we want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time when the blood donation will be organised.

* This process will be done using a Jupyter Notebook.
* The code should run w/o errors.
* Appropriate use of
    * data structures/types
    * loops/conditional statements
    * Packages
    * functions
    * coding practices (i.e. Docstrings, comments, variable names & general
      readability)
* Analysis
    * Pose questions about the data
    * Inspect the structure of the original data (very important)
    * Clean the data
    * Answer questions about the data using descriptive statistics
    * Visualize the data (using plt and seaborn)
    * Perform additional exploratory analysis
    * Consider where data analysis can be applied to other fields.
* Feature Engineering
    * Using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. 
* Machine Learning
    * Use Classification algorithms to make predictions.

## File Descriptions

* ./data/ contains the various datasets.
* ./Blood Donation Prediction.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook containing the work I have done.
